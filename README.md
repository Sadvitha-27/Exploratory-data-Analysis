# Exploratory-data-Analysis
For my EDA task, I focused heavily on data visualization to uncover trends within the Titanic dataset. After loading the data with Pandas, I cleaned missing entries and created a variety of plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I plotted countplots for categorical variables like Sex and Pclass to compare their survival outcomes.
